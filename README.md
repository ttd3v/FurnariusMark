A software that parses markdown files into HTML, it is meant to help automate the process of generating a good website for your projects. I intended to make it for generating documentation, but it is a tool and can be used however the user wants.

The software is written in C, so it can be as lightweight as possible, and easy to install â€” Compile, good to go. It does have dependencies (argp.h, asm-generic/errno.h, stdio.h, stdlib.h, and string.h), but they can be considered standard library and likely are already on your machine.

## Contribution
You can do a pull request with changes you think could help the project, and you can raise an issue to help me.

## Compatibility
The code itself relies on packages that can be considered standard library; even so, it is tied to Linux.
